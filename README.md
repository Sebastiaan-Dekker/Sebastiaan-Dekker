I am **a Financial Controller** with 5 years of experience at a fast-paced accounting firm. A proactive, dedicated, and hard-working employee with  interpersonal skills. Areas of expertise include financial accounting, management accounting, Dutch Taxation (VAT, CIT, Income Taxes), Financing, and Administrative Organisation. Besides all that, I really enjoy reviewing different companies' internal (financial) environments and improving them to a more professional and automated level. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently growing my skillset in Python applications within international banking and finance
- âš¡ Iâ€™m a part of [Executive MSc in International Finance (MIF)](https://abs.uva.nl/content/executive-master/master-in-international-finance-mif/master-in-international-finance.html?cb&cb) (Finance and Technology Track) at the University of Amsterdam. During this program, I wish to increase my financial knowledge, obtain new technical skills and insights, and combine these disciplines in my career.
